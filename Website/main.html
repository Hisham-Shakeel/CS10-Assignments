    <h2>Part 1: History</h2>
    <p class="big">
      What is History? How do Historians study the past as contrasted with
      Non-historians?
    </p>
    <img src="Images/History.jpg" />
    <p>
      <b>History</b> is the study of change over time, and it covers all aspects
      of human society. Political, social, economic, scientific, technological,
      medical, cultural, intellectual, religious and military developments are
      all part of history. Usually <b>professional historians</b> specialize in
      a particular aspect of history, a specific time period, a certain approach
      to history or a specific geographic region.
    </p>
    <p>
      Non-historians often say that "history repeats itself" or that "things
      were always this way." History cannot repeat itself because history is not
      a living, thinking being. History is an <b>intellectual discipline</b>
      practiced by historians who try to make sense of the past. Because history
      is about change, nothing was ever "always" a certain way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Non-historians often romanticize the past and speak of the "good old days"
      when they believe that things were generally better than at present.
      Conversely, some see history exclusively as a story of progress with
      everything constantly improving. People of all eras have made great
      achievements and committed terrible blunders; so processes of historical
      change cannot be categorized as either simple progress or regression.
      Historical processes involve complex relations between interrelated
      factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Non-historians derive information mainly from television, movies, and the
      internet as well as some books or magazines. They generally accept any
      sources uncritically as long as the source is interesting. Historians know
      that all sources, even those original to a particular historical time
      period, have some biases, omissions, contradictions, or various other
      limitations. That does not mean that such sources are completely invalid
      and useless; rather it means that historians have to know and study much
      to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of different sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historians who write history emphasize the value of
      <b>primary sources</b>, that is those sources actually dating from a
      particular time period, while understanding the limitations of such
      sources. Nonhistorians read books or watch documentaries, while historians
      do that plus go to archives in search of original records. [Historians who
      study non-English speaking regions must learn and use foreign languages.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Historians who write list all the sources that they have used in footnotes
      and bibliographies in their works. This helps other scholars who are
      interested to find those sources, and it shows that the writer is careful,
      thorough, and honestly giving credit for the origin of the writer's
      information. Providing <b>footnotes and a bibliography</b> is how
      historians demonstrate their methodology and support their conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Non-historians assume that historians have always approached history the
      same way. Historians know that the philosophy and methodology of history
      have changed over time and will keep changing. Many different
      interpretations of all historical topics exist. Historians must work to
      recognize the difference between facts and interpretations in their field.
      <b>Historiography</b> refers to the history, philosophy and methodology of
      history. Historians must be familiar with the historiography of their
      particular area of study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Non-historians often make broad generalizations about people, ideas,
      events, or time periods in history. Historians tend to focus more on the
      specific, detailed developments that underpin the generalizations, and
      sometimes question or reject the generalizations themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Non-historians may assume that time periods are fixed and absolute,
      whereas historians have various ways of organizing history thematically
      and chronologically. <b>Periodization</b>, to historians, is just a
      convenient form of broad organization, especially useful for course
      listings in university catalogs and subject headings in library catalogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      No historian can be 100% objective, but historians try to recognize their
      own limitations and biases. Historians try not to place the values,
      beliefs, behaviors, and attitudes of the present onto the topics they
      study. Historians try to understand their topics in the context of how and
      why people of that era thought and behaved, and not how people think and
      act today.

      <h2>Part 2: Coding</h2>
      <p class="bigger">How Does Coding Work?</p>
      <img src="Images/codecode.png" />
      <p>
        Computer programming languages, developed through a series of numerical
        or alphabetic codes, instruct machines to complete specific actions.
        Computer coding functions much like a manual.
      </p>
      <p>
        A programmer or developer writes instructions describing the information
        and tasks needed to create a visual or to perform a task. Computers scan
        extensive coded manuals very quickly, executing the tasks that create
        and run a successful website or application. Displaying an image or
        section of text, changing font styles, and opening emails all require
        instructions included in the coded manual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users interact with websites and apps with the help of these coded
        instructions. The code itself does not show up on the screen. Instead,
        people see the words and images a developer or programmer asks the
        computer to display.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coding tells a machine which actions to perform and how to complete
        tasks.
        <a
          href="https://www.computerscience.org/resources/computer-programming-languages/"
          >Programming languages</a
        >
        provide the rules for building websites, apps, and other computer-based
        technologies. Each programming language helps humans accurately
        communicate with machines.
      </p>
      <h2>Types of Programming Languages</h2>
      <p>
        Binary code comprises a series of zeros and ones, used to communicate
        instructions. This code is a low-level programming language. Each digit
        in a coded sequence connects to a switch in your computer. Each switch
        connects to an action, and together thousands of switches operate a
        device.
      </p>
      <p>
        High-level code, a computer communication process that works much like
        human language, allows programmers to operate entire systems
        simultaneously. High-level programming languages convert human language
        from programmers into binary code that computers understand.
      </p>
      <h2>What Is Coding Used For?</h2>
      <p>
        Developers use a variety of programming languages to build websites and
        applications. Front-end developers typically use HTML, CSS, or
        <a href="https://www.computerscience.org/resources/java/"
          >JavaScript code</a
        >
        to create website layouts and design functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developers use other languages like
        <a href="https://www.computerscience.org/resources/python/">Python</a>,
        Objective-C,
        <a href="https://www.computerscience.org/resources/c-sharp/">C#</a>,

          href="https://www.computerscience.org/resources/computer-programming-languages/swift/"
          >Swift</a
        >, or
        <a href="https://www.computerscience.org/resources/ruby-rails/"
          >Ruby on Rails</a
        >
        to create apps for cell phones and computer software.

          href="https://undsci.berkeley.edu/glossary/science/"

        white lab coats and microscopes, an astronomer peering through a
        telescope, a naturalist in the rainforest, Einstein's equations
        scribbled on a chalkboard, the launch of the space shuttle, bubbling

        <b>Science is both a body of knowledge and a process.</b> In school,
        science may sometimes seem like a collection of isolated and static
        <u>facts</u> listed in a textbook, but that's only a small part of the
        story. Just as importantly, science is also a process of discovery that
        allows us to link isolated facts into coherent and comprehensive
        understandings of the

      </p>
      <p class="bullet">
        <b>Science is exciting.</b> Science is a way of discovering what's in
        the universe and how those things work today, how they worked in the
        past, and how they are likely to work in the future. Scientists are
        motivated by the thrill of seeing or figuring out something that no one
        has before.

        <b>Science is useful.</b> The knowledge generated by science is powerful
        and reliable. It can be used to develop new

      <p class="bullet">
        <b>Science is ongoing.</b> Science is continually refining and expanding
        our knowledge of the universe, and as it does, it leads to new questions
        for future investigation. Science will never be "finished."
      </p>

        <b>Science is a global human endeavor.</b> People all over the world
        participate in the process of science. And you can too!
